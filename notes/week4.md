## Scan conversion of polygon

### Flood fill i.e. BFS

### Scan line
* Use intersections for scan lines to identify pixels that are **inside**

### Edge walking

### Convex

### Triangle rasterization
* Edge equation

### Aliasing

## Geometry

### Basic geometric elements
* Point
* Scalar
* Vector

### Vector
* Perspective projection needs vectors

#### Linear vector space
* No position, only direction and length

#### Affine space
* Points + vectors
* Position, direction, length
* Parametric form

#### Linear interpolation
* Affine combination of point A and B
  * P(t) = (1-t)A + tB

#### Convex
* Affine convex combination
* Convex Hull

#### Other geometry definitions
* Curves and Surfaces
* Plane
* Triangle
* Inner and outer product
* Normal

### Representation

#### Linearly independent

#### Dimension
* Largest number of elements in linearly independent vectors
* Basis: any n linearly independent vectors in n-dimensional space

#### Frame
* We need an origin and basis for reference in the coordinate system
